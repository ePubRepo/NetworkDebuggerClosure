// Hack to allow Closure to work in development mode with Packaged Apps
// Need to start the Closure dependency process and the timing of loading JS
// files is messed up so start the process only after the framework
// dependencies have loaded. In particular, launch a new Bootstrap();
// at the bottom of the bootstrap.js file, thereby ensuring it has been loaded.
